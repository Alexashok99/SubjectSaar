## 🛠️ Local Setup and Installation (For Developers)

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Alexshok99/SubjectSaar.git](https://github.com/Alexshok99/SubjectSaar.git)
cd SubjectSaar
````

### Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations (If applicable)

If this is a Django/Flask-SQLAlchemy project, you will need to apply migrations.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations # If Django
python manage.py migrate
```

*(Note: If you are using a different framework like Flask, replace these commands with your framework's database setup commands.)*

### Step 5: Run the Server

Start the local development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The application will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (default for Django).

## 💻 Technologies Used

  * **Backend:** Python
  * **Web Framework:** Django / Flask (Likely)
